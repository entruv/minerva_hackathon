# Neck Wonder

## Tagline

A creative sustaibable way to incentivize people to do neck exercises to prevent or cure neck strain 

## Summary Paragraph

With Neck Wonder, we are attempting to tackle a [US $88bn a year problem](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/10/epidemic-of-untreatable-back-and-neck-pain-costs-billions-study-finds) affecting one million people annually.By combining Machine Learning Models and and an attractive rewards scheme, we aim to help the white collared workers most affected by neck pain due to poor posture over long periods of time build a habit of stretching regularly and thus improving their postures.
